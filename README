NAME
    "IO::Async::Loop::IO_Ppoll" - compatibility wrapper for
    IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll

DESCRIPTION
    This class is a compatibility wrapper for programs that expect to find
    the Loop subclass which uses IO::Ppoll under this name. It was renamed
    to "IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll".

    Any program still referring to this class directly should be changed.

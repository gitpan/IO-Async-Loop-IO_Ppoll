NAME
    `IO::Async::Loop::IO_Ppoll' - compatibility wrapper for
    IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll

DESCRIPTION
    This class is a compatibility wrapper for programs that expect to find
    the Loop subclass which uses IO::Ppoll under this name. It was renamed
    to `IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll'. The API is exactly the same, only under a
    different name.

    Any program still referring to this class directly should be changed.
    This object constructor will print a warning when the object is created.

    Version 0.06 will likely be the last release of this distribution.
